This Python script collects and sorts new classifieds added to kijiij at set intervals (currently every hour) and if it meets the criterion  emails a notification of the posting to my email

The first thing to do is to install MailAlert on  harddrive. This is the program that is used to send the emails.

Search for the program mailalert from sourceforge with Google and install it.

The programs that I have are set up to run in the C:\MailAlert folder on the computer, so  install into the same folder on your computer.

There are 4 scripts that are run in sequence every hour.
They are:

chk_files_addnew.py
chk_files_filter.py
chk_files_mail.py
mail_stuff.cmd      <--- This file is created by chk_files_mail.py

?
 kijiji_searches.db3?
The python scripts use a SQLite database called kijiji_searches.db3, which store the search terms, exclusion terms and results.

The scripts are attached to this email and are pretty self explanatory. If you need any help deciphering this,  give me a call or email.


TO SET UP MAIL ALERT PROGRAM  

Replace the text [email address] with the email address that will be sending the Kijiji Alert messages.

Replace the text [email password with the password for the email address that will be sending messages

Save the text to a file called MailAlert.ini in the C:\MailAlert  folder.

That should get the emails working.
